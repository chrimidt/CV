\section{Introduction}

% [] Introduce the multi-label image classification problem and its challenges.

% [] Mention the two methods you investigate.

% [] Clarify that the methods are not compared directly, but evaluated independently against the reported baselines.


Multi-label classification is the supervised learning problem where an instance may be associated with multiple labels. Image classification is a computer vision task that requires assigning a label or multiple labels to an image. Single-label classification, or multi-class classification, refers to the problem where an image contains only one object to be identified. However, natural images usually contain multiple objects or concepts, highlighting the importance of multi-label classification \cite{ridnik2021mldecoderscalableversatileclassification}. In this project we investigate two methods aimed to solve two different problems within multi-label learning: Query2Label targets the challenges of imbalance and object localization, whereas MLSPL addresses the challenge of training an effective multi-label classifier from minimal supervision.

Query2Label: A Simple Transformer Way to Multi-Label Classification (Query2Label) by Liu et al. \cite{Query2Label} is a two-stage framework for multi-label classification. It uses transformer decoders to extract features with multi-head attentions focusing on different parts of an object category and learn label embeddings from data automatically.

Focus Methodology on the rationale for choosing these methods, how the operationalized their training, and any adaptations made for reproduction.

% ======================== Experimental Setup  ========================

\section{Experimental Setup}
A description of our setup and the author's setups.

\subsection{Dataset}
The MS-COCO 2014 \cite{coco14} dataset is used as a benchmark for evaluation both Query2Label and MLSPL. MS-COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) is a large-scale dataset commonly used for object detection, segmentation, and multi-label image classification. COCO consists of 82,081 training images and 80 classes, and a validation set of 40,137 images.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
\subsubsection{Query2Label}
We evaluated the Query2Label model using the best performing backbone model, the CvT-w24 backbone, with a $384\time 384$ input resolution, pretrained on the ImageNet-22k dataset, as described by Liu et al. \cite{Query2Label}. For our experiments, we used a pretrained model checkpoint released by the authors, which was trained on the MS-COCO 2024 dataset, described in the previous section. The model was tested on the MS-COCO 2024 validation set with a batchsize of 16 and otherwise no fine-tuning or modification.

% \paragraph{Hyperparameters}

\subsubsection{Multi-Label Learning from Single Positive Labels}
\paragraph{Data preparation}
The dataset preparation for the MS-COCO dataset in MLSPL relies on converting the standard multi-label MS-COCO dataset to a single positive label format, simulating a weakly supervised setting. Cole et al. does this beginning with the fully annotated multi-label image dataset and corrupt it by discarding annotations, simulating single positive training data by randomly selecting one positive label for each training example \cite{mlsp}.

\vspace{1em}

To convert into a single positive label format, the instructions provided by Cole et al. are followed: firsly, both images and annotations for training and validation are downloaded. Secondly, pre-extracted features for COCO, provided by the authors are downloaded. Lastly, the script \texttt{format\_coco.py} is used to produce uniformly formatted image lists and labels.

\vspace{1em}

\paragraph{Hyperparameters}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
To asses model performance, we adopt mean Average Precision (mAP), a standard metric widely reported in multi-label classification tasks as it is used to analyze the performance object detection and segmentation. Both Query2Label and MLSPL report results in terms of mAP. 

% ======================== Results and Discussion ========================

\section{Results and Discussion}
This section compares results from the experiments to the those of the papers. Discuss why they might not be the same, or describe the similarities. Discuss whether the methods are able to solve the problems.
